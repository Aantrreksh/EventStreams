# Using Kafka console tools with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
{: #kafka_console_tools }

Apache Kafka comes with a variety of console tools for simple administration and messaging operations. You can use many of them with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}, although {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} does not permit connection to its ZooKeeper cluster. As Kafka has developed, many of the tools that previously required connection to ZooKeeper no longer have that requirement.
