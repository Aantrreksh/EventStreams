# Understanding reserved disk usage
{: #ES_understanding_reserved_disk_usage}

This section describes how the usable storage of an Event Streams instance is used by the topics and partitions that are created and the configuration settings that you apply.

First of all, it's important to note that the defined storage of an Event Streams instance is usable storage. That means that you do not need to worry about storage used by replicas (as all topics have their replication factor set to 3) that is not taken from the usable storage. This keeps things simple and lets you to plan how to map the retention 
of those messages to storage usage.

## Understanding how Kafka stores data
{: #ES_understanding_how_kafka_stores_data}

Kafka allows users to configure retention limits on topics.

The retention.bytes configuration is the total number of bytes allocated for messages for each partition of the topic. If it is exceeded, Kafka deletes oldest messages. So for example, if you are generally sending in 200 MB a day of messages to a single partition topic, and you want to keep them for 5 days you would set retention.bytes to 1GB (200 MB x 5 days). 

If this was over 10 partitions, then you would set retention.bytes = 100 MB (1 GB / 10 partitions).

Internally Kafka splits each partition into log segments. This again is a property that you can set, log.segment.size, the default is 512 MB. When we mentioned that Kafka deletes the oldest messages, it really deletes the oldest log segment. For this reason, Kafka needs to keep space for one extra log segment, in addition to the number of log segments required to satisfy the retention.bytes configuration.

For example,

     retention.bytes = 1 GB
     log.segment.size = 512 MB
     kafka needs approximately 1.5 GB per partition for the topic storage.

or 

     retention.bytes = 100 MB
     log.segment.size = 512 MB
     kafka needs approximately 1 GB per partition for the topic storage.

More storage is needed per partition for indexes. For each log segment, Kafka also stores two indexes. Their sizes are defined by segment.index.size, which is also configurable and has a default of 10MB. For reference, the storage that is used by indexes is calculated as 

     2 x number.of.log.segments x segment.index.size

where 

     number.of.log.segments = floor(retention.bytes/log.segment.size) + 1
     
## Managing Storage with {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}
{: #ES_managing_storage_with_event_streams}     

When doing topic administration operations, such as creating topics, creating partitions, or changing topic configurations, Event Streams ensures that enough storage is available to satisfy the operation. To do this, for each topic, Event Streams computes the "reserved size" per topic by using the following method:

     Reserved size = retention.bytes + log.segment.size + (2 x segment.index.size x number.of.log.segments)

where 

     number.of.log.segments = floor(retention.bytes/log.segment.size) + 1


The total reserved storage percentage is also displayed in {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} by the [ibm_eventstreams_instance_reserved_disk_space_percent metric](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-metrics#ibm_eventstreams_instance_reserved_disk_space_percent).

If there is not enough unreserved storage to satisfy the topic operation, it is rejected with a PolicyViolation error detailing the reason.

**Note:** The reserved size calculation can change in the future if Kafka storage requirements are updated.

## Examples
{: #ES_managing_storage_with_event_streams_examples}  

A non-obvious effect is that Kafka can reserve more storage than expected depending on your topic configurations.

Let's consider a few examples:

1. A topic with retention.bytes of 1 GB, and with a log segment size of 512 MB:

    With one partition, it would reserve about 1.5 GB of storage
Â   
    In this case, the reserved size is significantly larger than the retention size.


2. A topic with retention.bytes of 50 GB, and with a log segment size of 512 MB:

    With 1 partition, it would reserve about 50.5 GB of storage
    
    In this case, the reserved size is very close to the retention size.


3. A topic with retention.bytes of 1 GB, and with a log segment size of 128MB:

    With 1 partition, it would reserve about 1.1 GB of storage
    
    In this case, the reserved size is very close to the retention size.
