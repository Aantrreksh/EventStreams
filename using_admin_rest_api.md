# Using the Administration REST API
{: #admin_api}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}} provides an Administration RESTful API that you can use to create, delete, list, and update topics.
{: shortdesc}

You must retrieve the URL and credential details that are needed to connect to the API from a service credentials object or service key for the service instance. For information about creating these objects, see [Connecting to {{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}](/docs/EventStreams?topic=EventStreams-connecting).

The URL for the API's endpoint is provided in the `kafka_admin_url` property.

The credentials depend on the authentication method and three types of credential are supported.

## Authenticate by using Basic Auth
{: #admin_api_basic_auth}

Use the `user` and `api_key` properties of the objects as the username and password. Place these values into the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request in the form `Basic <base64 encoding of username and password joined by a single colon (:)>`.
    
## Authenticate by using a bearer token
{: #admin_api_bearer_token}

To obtain your token by using the IBM Cloud CLI, first log in to IBM Cloud then run the following command: 

    ```text
    ibmcloud iam oauth-tokens
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Place this token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request in the form `Bearer<token>`. Both API key or JWT tokens are supported. 
    
## Authenticate by using the api_key
{: #admin_api_api_key}

Place the key directly as the value of the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header.

# Next steps
{: #admin_api_next_steps}
