# Using a Kafka client
{: #kafka_using}

{{site.data.keyword.messagehub}}  is currently based on
Kafka 0.10.2.1. If you're using the Java clients, you can use the publicly available Kafka clients at 0.10 or later. 

Kafka clients exist in multiple languages and we provide instructions for some of those languages. You can use others but you'll need SASL PLAIN support to provide credentials.
